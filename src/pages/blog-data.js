Darjeeling was where my love for the hills truly began. I still remember the crisp mountain air, the call of the Himalayan birds, and the gentle rumble of the toy train winding through pine trees and tea plantations. Sunrise at Tiger Hill was magical—watching the first rays kiss Kanchenjunga left me in awe.

Exploring colonial-era architecture, taking slow sips of world-famous tea at Nathmull's, and walking through the vibrant Chowrasta market became memories I cherish. The Peace Pagoda offered quiet reflection and panoramic views that took my breath away. Darjeeling is a symphony of calm, culture, and charisma.

Vizag (Visakhapatnam) surprised me. A coastal city with a blend of nature, history, and modern charm. I visited Rushikonda Beach at sunrise, feeling the cool sand underfoot as waves brushed my feet.

The submarine museum was fascinating—it’s not every day you walk through an actual war sub. Kailasagiri offered panoramic views of the entire coastline, best experienced via the ropeway. I ended my days with street food and seafood dinners along the RK Beach stretch. Vizag is not just a port city, it's an experience.

Chatakpur is where you go when you want to disconnect—from the internet, the crowd, and the rush of daily life. This tiny eco-village sits quietly amidst pine forests, just 20 km from Darjeeling.

I stayed in a wooden homestay run by locals and woke up to birdsong and views of Kanchenjunga. The hikes were serene, the air was pure, and the food—simple and soul-satisfying. Nights were spent stargazing and listening to the forest. Chatakpur is raw, real, and incredibly restorative.

North Sikkim was as challenging as it was beautiful. The winding roads, unpredictable weather, and high altitudes tested me—but the reward was immense.

Gurudongmar Lake was a spiritual experience. The still blue waters against the stark Himalayan backdrop felt surreal. Lachung and Yumthang Valley were no less—valleys bursting with flowers, streams, and an overwhelming sense of peace.

The local people, their resilience and kindness, made the trip even more meaningful. I returned with a deep respect for the mountains and their people.

    Manali gave me both adrenaline and calm. I tried paragliding in Solang Valley, got stuck in a snowstorm near Rohtang Pass, and then warmed up with coffee in the artsy cafés of Old Manali.

    Tibetan monasteries, wooden temples, apple orchards, and hot water springs in Vashisht filled my days. Evenings were for long walks by the Beas River and chats with travelers from around the world.

    It’s a perfect destination whether you want action or silence—and I had a bit of both.

Puri brought together my love for the sea and spiritual exploration. The grandeur of Jagannath Temple and the energy of the Rath Yatra festival were unlike anything I’ve seen before.

Evenings on Puri Beach were mesmerizing—waves, camel rides, snacks, and a carnival-like buzz. I also explored the artist village of Raghurajpur, where every wall tells a story through traditional Pattachitra paintings.

Puri is divine, lively, artistic, and a deeply rooted cultural destination.
